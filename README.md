# Thread_Java
This project is about Thread. I used lock, unlock, conditon, await, sleep and more...

<h2>Factorial</h2>
<pre>
<h4>Calculate rally using 3 ways:</h4>
One way through a loop.
Second way through creating two threads.
Third way through Fork Join.
</pre>
<h2>Lock and Condition</h2>
<pre>
The maximum amount of money in the account is 50.
We want to implement pull and deposit actions using Threads.
Pull and deposit were made under 2 Lock and 2 under two conditions.
So that each pull does not reach the minus, and each deposit does not exceed the maximum amount that can be stored.

<h2>Dead Lock</h2>
<pre>
The program runs two threads.
This creates a situation that each thread is waiting to hold a lock that the other hold and does not release.
So the program stuck.
